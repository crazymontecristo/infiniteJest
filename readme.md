## Goals

There are two overarching goals for the project:

1. Learn Python
2. Analyze and visualize text patterns in the book [Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest). 

This will be ongoing and most likely never be finished because the goals can never fully be accomplished.

## Directories

1. `data` - Data files organized by type.  Either made directly from text or scraped from the internet
2. `notes` - contain .md files that act as notebook for development for project. 
3. `r` - r scripts
4. `py` - python scripts
