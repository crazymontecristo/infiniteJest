# Goal 1: Map Characters By Position Within Book

## Date: November 5, 2014
The first goal is to map each character occurance by position. It has been around 5 months since I returned to this project and this is definitly a good lesson on reproduciblity.  I was able to do a prototype analysis by 

-Running `parser2.py` to extract characters from a list of one word characters `characters.oneword.txt` followed by position. 

    python py/ch.parser.py data/David-Foster-Wallace-Infinite-Jest-v2.0.txt data/characters.oneword.txt

This outputs postion and term into a file called `parserData.txt`.

What needs to be done to do this analysis properly.

## Characters
1. Make a proper list of characters. Hierarchical data structure? We need a list of all terms.  

**Plan** Maybe the best way to approach this problem is have the list of terms, treated all as seperate characters.  After the position is accounted for, merge with a list that groups them : Group List.  The group ID list will have multiple categories, then merge by 

for example: 

|term            | character | group     |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
|PGOAT           | Joelle    | incandenza|
|Joelle          | Joelle    | incandenza|
|Madam psychosis | Joelle    | incandenza|


- Make sure you can read in terms that are longer than one word. Find a way to store two word characters.
